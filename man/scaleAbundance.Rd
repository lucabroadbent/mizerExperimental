\title{Rescale Abundance}
\usage{
scaleAbundance(params, factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A mizer params object}

\item{factor}{The factor by which the abundance of each species is multiplied.
This can be specified in two ways:
\itemize{
\item A named numeric vector where the name indicates the species and the
value gives the factor for that species. Only the named species are
affected.
\item  A number that gives the factor for all foreground species.
}}
}
\value{
An object of type \linkS4class{MizerParams}
}
\description{
Multiplies the abundances of all or of selected species by given factors and
then retunes the reproductive efficiencies accordingly.
}
\details{
Does not run the system to steady state. For that you should call
\code{\link[=steady]{steady()}} explicitly afterwards.
