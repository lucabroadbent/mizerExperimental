\title{Calculate age at maturity}
\usage{
age_mat(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}
}
\value{
A named vector. The names are the species names and the values are
the ages at maturity.
}
\description{
Uses the growth rate and the size at maturity to calculate the age at
maturity
}
\details{
Using that by definition of the growth rate $g(w) = dw/dt$ we have that
\deqn{\mathrm{age_{mat}} = \int_0^{w_{mat}.}\frac{dw}{g(w)}}{age_mat = \int_0^w_mat 1/g(w) dw.}
}
\examples{
age_mat(NS_params)
